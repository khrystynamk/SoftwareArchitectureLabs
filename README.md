# **Software Architecture - Microservices Basics**

This repository contains a basic implementation of a microservices architecture using both **HTTP REST API** and **gRPC**.  

---

## üìÇ **Repository Structure**

The repository consists of two main implementations:  

- **HTTP-based implementation** using REST APIs.  
- **gRPC-based implementation**, located in the `gRPC` directory.  

A `.env` file is used in both implementations to define important variables such as service URLs.  

---

## üöÄ **Usage**

To run the system, you need to launch three microservices on different ports:  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Messages Service**
Not implemented yet, returns static text.
```sh
uvicorn messages_service:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8082
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Logging Service**
Handles logging messages.

- Using HTTP:
```sh
uvicorn logging_service:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081
```
- Using gRPC
```sh
python3 -m logging_service
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Facade Service**
Acts as a gateway that communicates with both services.
```sh
uvicorn facade_service:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
```

## üß™ Testing
To test the services, make sure all three applications (Facade, Logging, and Messages) are running.

You can send requests using the ```tests.http``` file or manually via ```curl``` commands:

### üîπ GET Request (Fetch messages)
```sh
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/facade_service"
```

### üîπ POST Request (Log a message)
```sh
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/facade_service" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"text": "This is a test message"}'
```

## üìä Results

Below are the results of various requests with different scenarios.  

- **1Ô∏è‚É£ GET Request - Empty Logging Response**

![GET Empty](img/get_empty.png)

- **2Ô∏è‚É£ POST Request - Successful Logging**

![POST Success](img/post.png)

- **3Ô∏è‚É£ GET Request - Contained Entries**

![GET Filled](img/get_filled.png)

- **4Ô∏è‚É£ POST Request - Retry Mechanism (Failure)**

![POST Failure](img/post_failure.png)

- **5Ô∏è‚É£ POST Request - Retry Mechanism (Success)**

![POST Success](img/post_success.png)

## **Additional tasks implemented**

- Retry and deduplication (Both with HTTP and gRPC)
- gRPC
